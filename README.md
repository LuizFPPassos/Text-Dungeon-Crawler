# Text-Based Dungeon Crawler in C#
##### Basic text-based dungeon crawler, similar to the influential game "Rogue" (actually developed before I knew about it)  
_Mostly for practicing_
#### Features:
- Random map generation with matrices, including algorithms for generating rooms, connecting them with corridors, generating a starting point and exit point, generating teleporters based on the overall rooms connectivity  
- Interface in WPF, including game log console similar to classic RPGs  
- Configurable game settings  
- Easily configurable variables  
- Custom font for the game elements  
- Torch illumination mechanic that runs out as the player walks around
- Auto scrolling game map that follows the player  

#### Planned updates:
- Add coloured elements  
- Improve map generation
- More realistic torch illumination
- Add looting system  
- Add combat encounters  
- Integrate previously developed combat mechanics
